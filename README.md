Github Repository for **GROUP 7** Data Mining Stock Price Prediction Final Project 
# Stock Market and Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market and cryptocurrency prices using linear regression analysis. By leveraging historical price and volume data, we aim to develop accurate models that can forecast asset prices and provide valuable insights for investors and market analysts.

## Dataset
The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketk511/2019-2024-us-stock-market-data/data) used in this project encompasses a comprehensive examination of market dynamics over a significant period. It includes historical price and volume data for various assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and key market indices. The dataset's features include date, price indices for stock markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, individual stock prices for companies like Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, as well as cryptocurrency prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Methodology
Our methodology primarily involves the application of Linear Regression analysis, complemented by exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We aim to discern and quantify the relationships between various market indicators and asset prices by analyzing key factors such as trading volumes, price indices, and external economic indicators. Additionally, we will engage in feature engineering to enhance the predictive capability of our models.
